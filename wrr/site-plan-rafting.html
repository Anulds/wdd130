    <p>My target Audience would be kids from the ages of 10 to 16 and all family members but kids under 10 should be under parent guidence.
      This is becuase once the kids will jump in to teen they will start showing lazyness and they will ignore there health consias activitys
      like swimming and others here they do swimming with playing, so they will enjoy. </p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
