In the book of Mormon, one of my favorite scripture 2Nephi 2:25 says "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy".  Here it says If the plan of salvation does not exist, If it hadn't been for Adam and eve fall, I wouldn't be here; you wouldn't be here; we would be waiting in the heavens as spirits. I am thankful to our heavenly father and his great plan and creation, fall through that we got to know the knowledge of good and evil.  Happy to be brothers and sisters to Jesus Christ the son of the heavenly father.  Because of the Creation, we got an opportunity to learn about Jesus Christ as a natural man like us with great attributes and his sacrifice and atonement.  Through him only we can go back and live with our heavenly father.
